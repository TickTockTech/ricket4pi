Basic principle is to allow access to robot buggy from a web-page.

First step:

 X Serve web-page
 X Add button to page to request sensor read.

Second step:

 X Extrapolate scan data to monochrome image.
 X Add granularity to tilt mechanism and messages.
 * Wheel click calibration with wall in-front.
 * Possible turn calibration using wall in-front and trig.
 X Add forward to interrupt command

Refactoring

 * Send id. with messages.
 * Break sock_main into smaller functions to break up large code sections

Improvements

 X Basic scan scans tighter area.
 X Return angle estimate from turn.
 X Return clicks and ir after move.
 * Remove client-side scan.
 * Basic scan will have incorrect scan lines due to right-left scanning
